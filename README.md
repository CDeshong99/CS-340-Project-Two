# üêæ Grazioso Salvare Dashboard - CS-340 Final Project

This repository contains my final dashboard project and supporting CRUD Python module created for Grazioso Salvare as part of the CS-340 course at SNHU. The dashboard was designed to visualize and interact with real animal shelter data using MongoDB, Dash, and Python.

## üí° Project Reflection

### ‚úÖ How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In this project, I implemented a Python CRUD module that served as the database interface for the dashboard. By encapsulating MongoDB operations within a dedicated class, I was able to reuse this component throughout the project and isolate database logic from the user interface. I wrote clean, modular code with descriptive method names and docstrings, which makes it easier to maintain and extend. In the future, this same module could be adapted to serve other applications that need to interact with MongoDB, like internal tools or admin dashboards.

### üß† How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approached this project by breaking it down into manageable parts: first ensuring the data was accessible and reliable, then designing the dashboard layout, and finally integrating interactivity with Dash callbacks. I prioritized functionality first, then refined usability and layout. Compared to previous projects, this one demanded more direct integration between frontend and backend logic. I applied object-oriented programming, structured testing, and API-driven thinking to ensure a reliable connection between components.

### üîç What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems using logical frameworks and technologies. In this case, my work enabled Grazioso Salvare to better understand and analyze animal data through an intuitive dashboard. By improving data visibility and interaction, computer scientists help organizations make faster, more informed decisions ‚Äî which, in this case, could impact animal rescue outcomes and resource allocation.
